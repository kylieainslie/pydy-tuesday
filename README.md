# pydy-tuesday

Welcome to my Pydy Tuesday repo. I am using the Pydy Tuesday project, part of the [Tidy Tuesday project](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday), to (finally) learn python!

The repo contains a folder for each week (`YYYY-MM-DD`) that I participate in and contains a Jupyter notebook (`pt_YYYY-MM-DD.ipynb`) with code and documentation of my exploration of that week's data.
